# Raspberry Pi Media Server

I will show you have to setup a miniDLNA server using Raspberry Pi. When you are finished configuring the server, you will be able to access your videos, photo or music from this server. It would be advisable to have some form of external storage connect via usb.

## Getting Started

These instructions will specifically show how to setup video streaming.
If you followed my instruction on how to setup [Torrent Server](https://github.com/asparatu/raspberrypi-transmission-daemon-client), you will be able to use the same Raspberry Pi as media server.

### Media Players

In order to watch the stream from media server, you can use [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) or [Windows Media Player](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-media-player-details.aspx). VLC media player is good, but in order to see newly added videos you need to close VLC and reopen it. Windows Media Player automatically updates the streams play list.
